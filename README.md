# Employee-Attrition-Prediction

This is a machine learning project on employee attrition prediction with Python programming language. Employees are considered the backbone of an organization. The success or failure of the organization depends on the employees who work for an organization.
Used exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset properly and by plotting a correlation matrix, I got a really good look at how the features relate to each other. After exploring our dataset, used Feature Engineering to create new features and relationships from the current features that we have.

Random Forest Classification Model used which predicts with 88% Accuracy.
